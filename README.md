Copy the std files into your main folder, so the path is main/std: https://github.com/kungfooman/cod2_std

    main/std::someStandardFunctionOfTheRepo()

This is code I wrote back in 2012, didn't touch since then and basically just uploading because it could be useful for some people. If your server will end up in flames because of reasons, you might wanna ask here: http://killtube.org/

It uses the libcod manymap system, so the map is linked from Library/mp_zeta.iwd to fs_game/mp_zeta.iwd automatically.

Back then I had a MySQL rank system in the code, but now I commented that code, because it crashed and IDC why. Maybe even some calls to the old closer() shit, had to fix the setVelocity/getVelocity to get it to work with kinda up2date libcod version (which I used for NS zombies).

All in all, kinda hacky, and if you want this to run on your server, there might be a few problems, but it shouldn't be too hard to fix it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Never finished the mod and got only this map. Stauffi† made another map once, but I cannot remember the name of it.
